				<div id="title_overview"><h3>Overview</h3></div>
				<div id="body_overview">

					<p>So one day, I wanted to improve my programming and math skills. I searched for problems to solve using a programming language and I stumbled upon
					<a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="blank">ProjectEuler.net</a> and I though it was the perfect problem source.</p>
					<p>If you check the code, you will notice that it is divided in two "areas", the first is the Project Euler problems "solver", the second is the
					infrastructure that allows you to call the problems and display the result (aka UI).</p>
					<p>At a previous iteration, the program used QT for its UI, but then, at the first portuguese Comicon I was testing the game of a friend and gave him
					a suggestion for a new feature, and he said that it would take to long to implement and I thought "too long, it takes like 10 minutes on Unity",
					then he told me that he was making the engine and that the feature would take too long to implement.</p>
					<p>So I started to think about the problems of implementing an engine(at least a small/simple one) and then decided to try my luck. I dropped all QT code
					and started working on a new UI using SDL2 with the final goal of creating a small puzzle game based on games like
					<a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/TwinkleStarGames/electric-box?acomplete=electr" target="blank">Electric Box</a> (which will, also, allow me to
					study more level design). </p>
					<br />

					<h3>How to compile the program</h3>
					<p>The development of the program is being done on a Linux system (fully updated Archlinux) using g++ as the compiler and GDB as the debugger. Other than the standard
					c++ libs, it used SDL2, SDL2_ttf, SDL"_image, boost::multiprecision lib and GMP(linux only). </p>
					<p>The boost::multiprecision lib is used because it let us change its backend lib. On linux it used GMP and on windows it used the "native" boost implementation (cpp_int) and
					the selection is made with preprocessor directives in the header file "defines.hpp". This approach was used as I was unable to correctly compile GMP and MPIR on windows.</p>

					<h4>Linux</h4>
					<p>On linux you can use the provided Makefile to compile the program and you need to have installed gcc, make, SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, boost and GMP. For easier
					instalation use your distro package manager to download and install the libs. The compiled program will be inside the "bin" folder.</p>

					<h4>Windows</h4>
					<p>The provided windows build was compiled using VS Express 2015. For you to compile it yourself, first you need to download the needed libs:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php" target="_blank">SDL2 (dev libs)</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/" target="_blank">SDL2_image (dev libs)</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/" target="_blank">SDL2_ttf (dev libs)</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.boost.org/" target="_blank">boost</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>After you download the libs create a new vs c++ project (I created an empty one and used "mainCRTStartup" as the linker entry point) and add the program source files (you need to add the lib/jsoncpp folder to your include search path). Add the
					include dirs for all the downloaded libs to your project include search path as well as add the 3 SDL libs "lib" subfolders (I used the x64 for all 3) to your lib search path.
				   	Finally your need to add SDL2.lib, SDL2main.lib, SDL2_ttf.lib and SDL2_image.lib to your linker input. The boost::multiprecision lib does not need any config from the linker as it is
			        a header only lib.</p>
				    <p>Now, you should be able to compile the program on windows (if you did not add the .dlls to your system or their path to environment path var, you need to put the .dlls next to the exe,
					you can find the .dlls in the lib folders for all SDL libs). In case you are unable to correctly configure the SDL libs check this <a href="http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/msvsnet2010u/index.php" target="_blank">tutorial</a>
					for them.</p>

					<h4>Folder and Files (Server)</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>'src/' - contains the entire source code</li>
						<li>'src/lib/' - contains external downloaded libs which source code will be compiled into the program (jsoncpp in this case)</li>
						<li>'src/include/' - all the header files</li>
						<li>'src/src/' - all the .cpp files. main.cpp is in 'src' and not this subfolder</li>
						<li>'docs/' - documentation generated by doxygen</li>
						<li>'bin/' - destination (with the correct data folder structure) for the build compiled by using the Makefile</li>
						<li>'objects/' - folder that store the object files generated during compilation</li>

						<li>'euler_short' - small bash script to run the program after compilation</li>
						<li>'Makefile' - default file used by make to compile the program (in the future I need to improve/simplify this file)</li>
						<li>'readme_boost.html' - this file</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Known bugs</h3>
						<p>On windows, problem 36 is crashing the program, I was able to identify where the problem is, but I have yet to start to correct it, therefore it was disabled in the provided
						windows build.</p>

					<h3>What next?</h3>
					<p>
						Next, is to keep solving problems and improving the UI, starting with solving the problem with text rendering.
					</p>
					<p>Any question or doubt you may have about the program, feel free to ask (olavojmc@gmail.com).</p>

				<div id="title_application"><h3>The application</h3></div>
				<div id="body_application">
					<p>For this application I chose to use C++ (c++11/14) and use the maximum of its native and stl(like threads, clock and unique_ptr)
						functionalities before relying on external libs. For that reason
						I am only using SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, GMP(not on windows), jsoncpp and boost::multiprecision as external libs (all cross-platform, except for the problems with GMP).
						The 'src' folder contains the source code, 'docs' folder contains the output of doxygen for this problem and the 'bin' folder has a linux build in there.
						The euler_short script is just a shortcut to run the program if you are using a terminal to build it (on linux).
						</p>
					<p>The comments used to generate the doxygen files, are present in the header files only, cpp files comments are only notes regarding the implementation.</p>
					<p>Now I'll give a brief description about some of the files that contain the UI code.<br />
						poker_hand.cpp/.h, utils.cpp/.h, graphs.h, eulerproblems.h
						and every file inside the problems folder contain the implementation of the problems and their support functions. Keep in mind that things are being
						implemented as I need them, so some classes may look very incomplete.</p>

						<h4>main.cpp</h4>
						<p>Where it all starts, the program entry point. Owns the main state machine for the problems and the main loop that reads inputs,
							calls logic state function and renders the scene, also controls SDL init and termination</p>

						<h4>button.cpp/.h</h4>
						<p>Class to display a generic button</p>

						<h4>clock.cpp/.h</h4>
						<p>Basic SINGLETON class to manage a small clock to be mainly used by Euler Problems functions to time their execution</p>

						<h4>configparser.cpp/.h</h4>
						<p>Tries to load(from file) application configuration into config_json var</p>

						<h4>message_writer.cpp/.h</h4>
						<p>Singleton class controlling a basic threaded output writer to the console and/or output box.
							Currently the output to the UI is disabled due to some problems with texture corruption</p>

						<h4>object.cpp/.h</h4>
						<p>Base class for any element, to be like GameObject in Unity3d (although its far from it, for now)</p>

						<h4>problems_menu.cpp/.h</h4>
						<p>One of the states used by the main.cpp state machine. It lets the user call for problems and displays their result.</p>

						<h4>splash_screen.cpp/.h</h4>
						<p>One of the states used by the main.cpp state machine. For now its just a simple splash screen before the problems state.</p>

						<h4>state_machine.cpp/.h</h4>
						<p>Simple state machine that works with stateinterface objects</p>

						<h4>text.cpp/.h</h4>
						<p>Class to render text on screen. Currently not suited for displaying dynamic text because for each change causes a new texture to be created
							and the previous to be destroyed. I am, already, working on a solution based on spritesheet font.</p>

						<h4>texture.cpp/.h</h4>
						<p>Class that takes care of loading and storing a texture to be rendered</p>

						<h4>structs.h</h4>
						<p>Defines multiple structs that are used by </p>

						<h4>stateinterface.h</h4>
						<p>Basic Interface to be used by the main state machine</p>

						<h4>input_interface.h</h4>
						<p>Basic Interface to add behaviours to elements</p>

						<h4>renderinterface.h</h4>
						<p>Basic Interface to add render behaviours to elements</p>

					<p>Currently only the problems available are 1-25,27,29,30,34-36,42,48,67,81</p>
					<p>Bellow a brief notes on the problems, based on my experience solving then</p>
				</div>


				<div id="body_problems">
					<div id="p001">
						<h4>Problem 001 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=1" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>Nothing special about this problem</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p002">
						<h4>Problem 002 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>Simple Fibonacci implementation with the specific conditions of the problem</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p003">
						<h4>Problem 003 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=3" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>This problem does not have anything special itself, but it was for this problem that I first implemented the Sieve of Eratosthenes </p>
					</div>
					<div id="p004">
						<h4>Problem 004 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=4" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>For this problem I implemented a function to check if a number is palindromic, initially I used strings the changed the implementation to math operations</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p005">
						<h4>Problem 005 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=5" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>The Least Common Multiple function used by this problem is a little "heavy" (the prime factor calculation is not the fastest function,
							although the use of a pre-created prime vector helps) and I may need to find a better solution</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p006">
						<h4>Problem 006 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=6" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>Nothing special about this problem</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p007">
						<h4>Problem 007 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=7" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>As I solved this problem after solving problem 003 it was only a matter of calling the sieve</p>
					</div>

					<div id="p008">
						<h4>Problem 008 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=8" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>Nothing special about this problem</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p009">
						<h4>Problem 009 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=9" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>In this problem was one in which I remembered how awesome math is and how simple formulas can solve "complex" problems.
							So for this problem, and after some research, I found the great Euclid's formula that allowed me to solve this problem with ease</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p010">
						<h4>Problem 010 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=10" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>Once again Sieve Of Eratosthenes to the rescue</p>
					</div>
					<hr />
					<div id="p011">
						<h4>Problem 011 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=11" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>This problem is not hard, although it took me a while to solve because my approach was overcomplicated.
							After a small discussion with a former coworker I arrived at the current solution, which is very basic.
							Once again a second look a problem can help a lot.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p012">
						<h4>Problem 012 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=12" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>By applying the Triangle number formula and the prime factor function, the solution was easy to reach</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p013">
						<h4>Problem 013 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=13" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>So this was the first problem that needed file reading and the use of a big number external lib (boost with GMP/cpp_int)</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p014">
						<h4>Problem 014 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=14" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>Nothing special about this problem</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p015">
						<h4>Problem 015 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=15" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>Ah, problem 15, good old problem 15, the problem that took me the longest to solve.
							Once again, not because it is hard, but because I was fixed in a solution and did not see anything else.</p>
						<p>So, when I read the description I though graphs, graphs and graphs. I implemented two modified graph traversals algorithms
							(the code is there but not in use), the first one based on Depth-first search (very very slow)
							and the second based on Breadth-first search (very slow and "eats" lots of memory). Then, after a lucky search result I noticed that the problem
							could be easily solved by a simple permutation calculation (the one in use)</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p016">
						<h4>Problem 016 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=16" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>Nothing special about this problem other than the fact that I needed to use a power function from boost with GMP/cpp_int</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p017">
						<h4>Problem 017 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=17" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>Funny problem, not hard, but I do not like the result algorithm that much (in the future I might take a new look at it)</p>
					</div>

					<div id="p018">
						<h4>Problem 018 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=18" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>When I read the description I though graphs, graphs and graphs (seems familiar?), but this time it turned out to be an excellent solution.
							So I implemented a modified version of the Dijkstra's  search algorithm and it worked like a charm.
							Problem 067 is the same as 018 but with a bigger graph. I really enjoyed solving this one.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p019">
						<h4>Problem 019 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=19" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>When reading the description of this problem I remembered that there are algorithms to find days of the week,
							so I searched and and implemented one of then, in this case a Gauss's algorithm.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p020">
						<h4>Problem 020 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=20" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>This is the first problem using multithreading.
							Given the complexity of the problem, the use of threads is not really necessary,
							although at the time I was testing C++11 threading and it gave me faster results so I kept it.</p>
					</div>
					<hr />
					<div id="p021">
						<h4>Problem 021 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=21" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>Nothing special about this problem</p>
					</div>
					<div id="p022">
						<h4>Problem 022 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=22" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>
						<p>For this problem I had to create some functions to manipulate strings, like Trim and Explode.</p>

						<h4>Problem 024 - <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=24" target="blank">Euler Link</a></h4>

					<p>Currently the following problems are being worked on 26,47,61,72,82 and 94</p>
					<p>I will only speak about 72 and 94 as they are in a "special" stage, the others are either incomplete or have some error that I have yet to find.</p>
					<p>Both 72 and 94 are solved, at least mathematically, and both suffer from the same problem floating point precision.<br />
						For 72 the solution passed by a sum of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function" target="blank">phi (Euler's totient function)</a> for 1 &lt; n &lt; 1000000001

						When the upper limit &le; 100000000 (100 millions) equals the one from wolphram, when the limit is the on of the problem (1 thousand of millions) the value misses
						My analysis takes me to believe that when the prime number used by 'phi' is to big it causes precision error.<br />
						For 94 the problem found is that some values are losing the decimal part, that is, some result, if calculated by hand give a result with decimal, but the algorithm cuts it and return
